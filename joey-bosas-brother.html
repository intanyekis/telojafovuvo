His older brother, <a href=# rel=noopener>Joey Bosa</a>, is also a defensive end for the Los Angeles Chargers.&nbsp;</p><p>The involvement of the Bosa family in the NFL goes back to the time of their grandfathers’ contribution.&nbsp;</p><p>Some families appear to be destined for NFL glory.

We can guess that their father’s position inspired the two Bosa sons.&nbsp;</p><p>John Bosa was the 16th overall choice in the 1987 NFL Draft. His kids took up the legacy and carried it even further.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, the family line in NFL doesn’t end there; the Bosa brothers’ uncle Eric Kumerow and their cousin Jake Kumerow have also been a part of the NFL’s legacy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Despite his interest in sports, Nick Bosa also prioritized his education equally.
