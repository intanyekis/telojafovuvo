The trio known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roman Reigns</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rollins</a>, and<a href=#> Dean Ambrose </a>took the wrestling world by storm when they made their WWE debut at Survivor Series back in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The trio became known as The Hounds of Justice and were recognized as future World Champions from that point. The three men have since gone their separate ways and over the past three years, their stranglehold on the WWE has become much tighter than any trio before them.</p><p>All three men have now become World Champions, with Roman holding the title three times, Seth holding it twice, and Dean picking it up just once. Roman has also won The Royal Rumble match and, along with Seth Rollins and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brock Lesnar</a>, main evented WrestleMania 31 and followed this up by main eventing WrestleMania 32 against <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple H</a> and recently at WrestleMania 33 against <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Undertaker.&nbsp;</a></p><p>These three men have changed the landscape of WWE over the past five years and it seems that they have had some incredible matches along the way. Whether they were working as a trio or as singles stars, here are the 15 best matches from the three members of The Shield.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roman-vs-the-undertaker---wrestlemania-33>Roman Vs. The Undertaker - WrestleMania 33</h2><p>Roman Reigns took on The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33 in what is thought to have been The Undertaker's final wrestling match. The Deadman was given the main event of the show and Jim Ross returned to call the match as The Undertaker seemingly took his bow on the Grandest Stage of Them All.</p><p>Take nothing away from Roman Reigns, he may be unpopular with the fans, but he can wrestle when the spotlight is on him and he&nbsp;proved that back in April against The Phenom. There was a slight botch in the match near the end which means the match can't be put any further up the list, but this isn't Roman's only singles match in the main event of WrestleMania.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tradition-survivor-series-match-2016>Tradition Survivor Series Match 2016</h2><p>When WWE decided to split back into two brands they put Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns on Raw and left their former brother Dean Ambrose on SmackDown with the WWE Championship. This didn't sit too well with The Shield brothers and so they decided to make it known at Survivor Series in 2016.</p><p>SmackDown took on Raw in the main event in a traditional five-on-five elimination match. When AJ saw Dean eliminated from his own team, Ambrose returned and his brothers then helped him to triple powerbomb AJ through the announcer table and pop the entire arena. This was the last time that fans have seen a Shield reunion, despite all three currently being on the Raw brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roman-reigns-vs-dean-ambrose---survivor-series-2015>Roman Reigns Vs. Dean Ambrose - Survivor Series 2015</h2><p>Seth Rollins may have turned on his brothers in June 2014 but Roman and Dean remained close friends and even continued to help each other after The Shield was over. This made it even more exciting when Rollins was injured in November 2015 and forced to relinquish the World Championship.</p><p>Roman and Dean made it to the final of the World Championship Tournament at Survivor Series and were forced to face off for the first time. Roman came out the victor but there were great moments where Ambrose stated that "Winner buys the beers" and then the duo celebrated in the ring together before Sheamus came down to successfully cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-shield-vs-evolution---extreme-rules-2014>The Shield Vs. Evolution - Extreme Rules 2014</h2><p>Triple H thought The Shield was&nbsp;a good idea, but that was before it was made obvious that the team had been given too much power and someone needed to step in and take them back down to size.</p><p>Hunter called on a few old friends in the form of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Randy Orton</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Batista</a> (sorry <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ric Flair,</a> they didn't actually need you) and Evolution was reformed and attempted to take down The Hounds of Justice. The six men main evented Extreme Rules in a tag team match and once again, Rollins stole the show when he jumped off the balcony and took out Triple H and Orton so that Roman Reigns could secure the pin in the ring with Batista.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=seth-rollins-vs-cm-punk---raw-2013>Seth Rollins Vs CM Punk - Raw 2013</h2><p>Seth Rollins versus <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CM Punk</a> was always thought to be an Indy wrestling fan's fantasy match, much like Seth Rollins versus AJ Styles.&nbsp;The match wasn't given the hype it deserved but it was still considered a pleasure to see the two men in the same ring.</p><p>CM Punk was part of a storyline at this point where he was attempting to find the crack in The Shield and play the three brothers off against each other. Rollins lost the match which proved that he wasn't the best member of the group, but he later proved that he was really the crack when he was the reason the group broke up in June 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=seth-rollins-vs-brock-lesnar-vs-john-cena---royal-rumble-2015>Seth Rollins Vs. Brock Lesnar Vs. John Cena - Royal Rumble 2015</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Cena</a>, Seth Rollins, and Brock Lesnar fought it out for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at The Royal Rumble back in 2015 in what was actually an incredible match from all three stars.</p><p>Rollins was inserted into the match by The Authority, even though at the time he still had the Money in the Bank case and could cash in whenever he wanted. He played a much weaker heel character and was unable to put much offense together before he was the one who took the pin off an F5. This was the first time the WWE Universe witnessed The Phoenix Splash, even though Rollins failed to hit it.</p><h2 id=seth-rollins-vs-finn-balor---summerslam-2016>Seth Rollins Vs. Finn Balor - SummerSlam 2016</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finn Balor and Seth Rollins collided in the main event of last year's SummerSlam in what could have been one of the best matches of either man's career. Balor suffered a dislocated shoulder and a whole host of other issues merely minutes into the match when he was thrown into the barricade by Rollins, but somehow managed to continue.</p><p>The match was still considered to be an incredible showing from both men that saw Balor come out on top at his first ever pay-per-view event on the main roster. Balor was obviously forced to relinquish the title the following night when it was revealed that he would need surgery and the true heroics of the night before were finally made public.</p><h2 id=seth-rollins-and-roman-reigns-vs-team-hell-no---extreme-rules-2013>Seth Rollins And Roman Reigns Vs.

Dean Ambrose defeated Kofi Kingston on the kick off show to become the United States Champion before Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns took on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Bryan </a>and Kane, known as Team Hell No.</p><p>The Shield fought hard and finally, after a knee to the face, it was declared that Reigns and Rollins were the new Tag Team Champions and all three members of The Shield walked out of Extreme Rules wearing the collars that proved that it was their yard now. Sadly, it only remained their yard for&nbsp;just over a year afterwards, but what a year that was!</p><h2 id=seth-rollins-vs-dean-ambrose-vs-roman-reigns-vs-randy-orton---payback-2015>Seth Rollins Vs.

Randy Orton - Payback&nbsp;2015</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seth Rollins won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 31 and after managing to retain his Championship in a match against Randy Orton inside a steel cage at Extreme Rules, the odds were definitely out of his favour at Payback.</p><p>One of the biggest moments of the match was when The Shield reunited for a few seconds to triple powerbomb Randy Orton through the announcer table before Roman and Dean once again turned on Seth. The numbers game worked to Rollins' advantage with Kane and J&J Security on his side, which allowed him to retain and live to fight another day. It was a fatal-four-way that will always be remembered in the mind of Shield fans.</p><h2 id=seth-rollins-vs-roman-reigns---money-in-the-bank-2016>Seth Rollins Vs. Roman Reigns - Money In The Bank 2016</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seth Rollins made his dramatic return from an injury at Extreme Rules in 2016 and showed the WWE Universe that he was coming for the Championship he never lost, when he Pedigreed Roman Reigns in the middle of the ring.</p><p>Their match was set for Money in the Bank and after it was revealed backstage that Reigns had failed a Wellness Test, Rollins was able to take the Championship out of his grasp at the first attempt. Just as Rollins was about to celebrate, Dean Ambrose cashed in the Money in the Bank case he had won earlier in the night and finally managed to defeat his former brother and take away his title. All three members of The Shield held the Championship in the space of 30 minutes.</p><h2 id=the-shield-vs-cm-punk---tlc-2013>The Shield Vs CM Punk - TLC 2013</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2013, CM Punk had a vendetta against The Shield and at TLC he paid for it when he was put in a 3-on-1 handicap match against all three members. It was thought that this would be punishment, but somehow Punk managed to move out of the way of a spear, so Roman speared Dean and Punk pinned the fallen Hound.</p><p>This was sadly Punk's last pay-per-view match aside from The Royal Rumble where he was eliminated by Kane. It is also one of the most memorable matches in the career of Punk as he once again defied the odds and&nbsp;still managed to "make Roman look strong."</p><h2 id=the-shield-vs-evolution---payback-2014>The Shield Vs. Evolution - Payback 2014</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What can you possibly say about this match? It was perfect. After their tag match decided that The Shield were the best team at Extreme Rules, Evolution wanted to play the numbers game and decided an elimination match at Payback would be the way to go.</p><p>The match wasn't even about eliminations for Evolution, who picked apart The Shield with chairs and kendo sticks before Rollins dived off The Titantron and took out the trio and helped The Shield regain control. The Shield then completed a clean sweep of the team in what was their final match as a trio since Rollins turned on his brothers the following night on Raw.</p><h2 id=roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar---wrestlemania-31>Roman Reigns Vs. Brock Lesnar - WrestleMania 31</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roman Reigns was wide eyed when he stepped in the ring with Brock Lesnar in his first ever WrestleMania main event, something he earned when he won The Royal Rumble. Reigns knew Lesnar would not be an easy person to defeat with the World Championship on the line but he put up a good fight.</p><p>Reigns came the closest to defeating Lesnar one-on-one the entire time he held the Championship and the WWE Universe still don't know who actually won this match. Rollins ran down and cashed in his Money in the Bank case before pinning Roman and taking the title, which means that a rematch between these two is definitely going to happen in the near future.</p><h2 id=the-shield-vs-the-wyatt-family---elimination-chamber-2014>The Shield Vs. The Wyatt Family - Elimination Chamber 2014</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes in wrestling two teams are born to face each other, and when it came to promo ability and the follow through of the match, there was no one better than The Shield and The Wyatt Family. Promos between Bray Wyatt and Dean Ambrose set up what was an absolutely incredible feud between the two best stables in WWE at that time.</p><p>The crowd was chanting "This Is Awesome" before the match had even begun and despite the fact that Rollins was put through a table, Ambrose went missing in the crowd and Reigns was the one left to take the wrath of the family, it was still considered to be the match of the show and one of the best of 2014. The Shield were never able to defeat The Wyatt Family on pay-per-view the entire time they were together but this was a stand out match regardless.</p><h2 id=dean-ambrose-vs-seth-rollins---mitb-2014>Dean Ambrose Vs. Seth Rollins - MITB 2014</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wrestling soulmates doesn't quite cover what Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose actually are. Not only were the duo able to tag together cohesively for a number of years, but when it was decided that they would branch out into a feud, it was the best feud of the current generation.</p><p>Some of the matches were outstanding and one particular always stands out and that is when the duo fought for the World Championship at Money in the Bank in 2015. It was Rollins who won the match but the duo climbed the ladder together, took the title together and had the WWE Universe on eggshells for a while before it was decided that Rollins was the winner because he held on to the Championship when he fell to the ground.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJ%2BlenKBjJucrKxdoq61r8eeqmaeoqS6bsDHnmSmnZ2XsrO%2FjKidZqyYmnq0tMieo51n</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2ftop-15-best-matches-from-the-members-of-the-shield.html&title=Top%2015%20Best%20Matches%20From%20The%20Members%20Of%20The%20Shield" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-15-best-matches-from-the-members-of-the-shield.html&description=Top%2015%20Best%20Matches%20From%20The%20Members%20Of%20The%20Shield" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-15-best-matches-from-the-members-of-the-shield.html&title=Top%2015%20Best%20Matches%20From%20The%20Members%20Of%20The%20Shield" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2ftop-15-best-matches-from-the-members-of-the-shield.html&title=Top%2015%20Best%20Matches%20From%20The%20Members%20Of%20The%20Shield" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2ftop-15-best-matches-from-the-members-of-the-shield.html&text=Top%2015%20Best%20Matches%20From%20The%20Members%20Of%20The%20Shield" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2ftop-15-best-matches-from-the-members-of-the-shield.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-31</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./conor-maynard.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Conor Maynard</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./sophie-rose-chelsea.html><h3>Sophie Rose, Chelsea, Body, Career, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
